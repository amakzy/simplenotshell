Here is a simple README for creating a shell in C:

# Simple Shell

This project is a simple implementation of a command line shell in C.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need a C compiler installed on your system. You can use `gcc` on Linux or macOS, or `cl` on Windows.

## Compiling

To compile the shell, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o shell
```

This will create an executable file called `shell`.

## Running

To run the shell, simply execute the `shell` file from the command line:

```
./shell
```

You should now see a prompt where you can enter commands.

## Features

This simple shell supports basic commands such as `cd`, `ls`, and `exit`. It also supports input and output redirection using `<` and `>`.
and more.
